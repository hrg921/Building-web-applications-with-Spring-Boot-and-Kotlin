# Building-web-applications-with-Spring-Boot-and-Kotlin

This tutorial shows you how to build efficiently a sample blog application by combining the power of Spring Boot and Kotlin.

If you are starting with Kotlin, you can learn the language by reading the reference documentation, following the online Kotlin Koans tutorial or just using Spring Framework reference documentation which now provides code samples in Kotlin.

Spring Kotlin support is documented in the Spring Framework and Spring Boot reference documentation. If you need help, search or ask questions with the spring and kotlin tags on StackOverflow or come discuss in the #spring channel of Kotlin Slack.
